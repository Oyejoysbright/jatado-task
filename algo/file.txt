Take user's file, preferred file extension and step (which the number of . in the extension)
Set a variable RES to "."
Get file extension of the user's file by:
    Split file name into characters
    looping through the file name from behind
        Check for extension step (.pdf, .d.ts) so as to terminate if completed
        add the current looping char to the RES variable
        Check if current looping char is "." so as to terminate 
    Check if the file name is among the preferred file extension
Feed the user back with the value of variable RES



BIG O NOTATION

;let f be the length of the file name
;let p be the index of . indicating the start of the extension

1 + (3 ^ (f-p)) + 1 + 1

Where,

1 is splitting the file name
f-p is the number of times looping will occur before the extension is found
3 ^ x is the operations for getting the extension
1 is the operation of checking if the found extension is acceptable
1 is returning the data back to the user

Thus, when f = 20 and p = 17
We will have 30
