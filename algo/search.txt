Take user's search string and JSON data to search
Set a variable(RES) to store the filtered objects
Split the search string
Set a variable(V) to zero
Loop the JSON Data
    Set a variable(C) to zero (0)
    In each looping block, loop through JSON Object
        Find number of times split search character(s) present in every object value by looping search characters and checking for inclusion
        update the value of variable C if number of occurrence in the previous step is greater
    After object looping, add object to the variable RES as the first element if value of variable C is greater than variable V, otherwise add as the last object provided that the variable C is not zero
Feed the user back with the value of variable RES


BIG O NOTATION

;let n be length of search characters
;let l be the length of the data to search through
;let m be the length of each object in the data

1 + (((n^2 + 1) ^ m) ^ l ) + 1

Where,
1 is the splitting operation
n ^ 2 + 1 is the loop of search characters and checking of inclusion and update operation
x ^ m is the looping of each object
x ^ l is the looping of the search data
1 is returning the filtered data to the user

So, when n is 2, m is 2 and l is 3
